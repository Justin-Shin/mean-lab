# MEAN Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended pair lab! It is up to you and your teammate to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application should be MEAN. This includes...
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Using **MongoDB** as your database.
* Using **Mongoose** as your ODM.
* Adding **Angular** as your front-end. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.

Your app should have CRUD functionality for at least one model.

### Bonus I

Add a second model to your application, which is nested under the first.

### Bonus II

Allow the user to log-in using Twitter.

## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner after the lab has been introduced.

### Some ideas

- A StackOverflow-style question/answer page
- Recipe / Ingredients manager
- Competitive Cookie Clicker
- Image tagger
- A digital notebook

* A link to your lab repo
